This is a Web Application developed using Flask framework

this app will take youtube channel URL as a input from the search of the index.html 

will return details of all videos. I've limited the count to 5, can be extended as much as needed.

"youtube API key is needed to the execute the app"

to improve the performance of app, have used Asynchronisation techniques

modules : asyncio (for async methods) & aiohttp (for http session)

    
feel free to use and let me know if you need any assistance on the same.

this webapplication:

tested at localhost

tested after deploying it in AWS (concepts used : Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline)

both are success 100%
